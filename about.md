# Welcome to DevNest

DevNest is a Slovakian based one-person software studio, dedicated to building high-quality macOS and iOS applications.

With a strong focus on Apple platforms, DevNest combines clean design, native performance, and attention to detail to create tools that feel at home on your device. What started as personal side projects has grown into a professional venture aimed at delivering thoughtful, user-centered software.

The first app released along this journey was PhotoMiner — a utility originally created to help rediscover forgotten photos scattered across internal or external drives, often in folders users may not even remember existed. While it’s no longer under active development in its original form, a redesigned and reimagined successor is currently in development.

At DevNest, the goal is simple: to craft reliable, elegant tools that make everyday tasks easier for Mac users.
